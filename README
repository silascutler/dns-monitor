DNS Monitor
(c) Silas Cutler 2012

This is a demo release.  Please email me with any questions or bugs

DNSMonitor is a set of scripts that monitor dns names for IP address changes, when the current TTL of a domain expires.  The data is logged locally in a SQLite database which can easily be searched through. 


=Installation=
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Getopt::Long,Net::DNS,DBI::SQLite,Thread::Pool'


Use controller.pl to control any operational parts of the domain monitoring (ie. Add domain, remove domain, etc.).  Resolver.pl will automatically query the database for domains that need to be resolved.  Best usage is to run resolver.pl in a screen session.
